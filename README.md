# OCR-Using-ANN-and-Random-Forest
This project involves developing two distinct Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems: one utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the other employing a Random Forest classifier. The aim is to compare the performance of these two machine learning approaches in accurately converting handwritten text into machine-encoded text.
